    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a program that allows the user to enter their current temperature in Fahrenheit and find\n",
    "out whether it is warm, hot, or cold based on the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the temperature is above 85째F, it is considered hot.\n",
    "- If the temperature is between 60째F and 85째F, it is considered warm.\n",
    "- If the temperature is below 60째F, it is considered cold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deliverables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program that asks the user for their current temperature in Fahrenheit and\n",
    "outputs whether it is warm, hot, or cold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the following reserved words in your code: `if`, `elif`, `else`\n",
    "- Use proper indentation to denote blocks of code.\n",
    "- Use variables to store the input temperature and the result.\n",
    "- Include comments in your code to explain what the code is doing.\n",
    "- Use data types to store the temperature (e.g. float or int).\n",
    "- Use operators to compare the temperature against the thresholds.\n",
    "- Use boolean expressions to determine the output result.\n",
    "- Use an if-elif-else statement to implement the conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Submission Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete your program using a Jupyter Notebook. Once you are comfortable that your program is functioning correctly, submit your notebook file (*.ipynb) to Canvas to submit your homework assignment."
